# ðŸ’¡ How to exit vim (and other happy-fun lessons for vim noobs)

For now this can only be installed if you have Go. I promise there will be an official release (with `goreleaser`) after we finish it. (See the [`dot/install/ubuntu/install-go`](https://github.com/rwxrob/dot) to install latest Go version.)

```golang
go install github.com/rwxrob/learnvim@latest
```
