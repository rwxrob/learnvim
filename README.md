# ðŸ’¡ How to exit vim (and other happy-fun lessons for vim noobs)

For now this can only be installed if you have Go. I promise there will be an official release (with `goreleaser`) after we finish it. 

```golang
go install github.com/rwxrob/learnvim@latest
```

You can install latest go into your own Linux/amd64 home directory with the following:

```sh
curl -L https://raw.githubusercontent.com/rwxrob/dot/main/install/ubuntu/install-go | bash
```
