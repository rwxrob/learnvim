                Welcome to the (smarter) Vim tutorial!
========================================================================

   Vim is the most powerful and ubiquitous terminal-based editor ever
   created. Everyone should learn it simply because it is often the only
   editor available from the terminal. This tutorial addresses several
   major errors and omissions in the original vimtutor.

   This tutorial is for absolute beginners. Contrary to popular belief,
   Vim basics can be mastered in 10 minutes making basic Vim far easier
   to learn than even nano for beginners (yes, including exiting).
   Beginners can layer additional Vim skills on top of the basics. Like
   so many things in the UNIX/Linux universe, there is always more to
   learn. Hopefully, starting you out right will boost your interest to
   get started and learn the rest.

                     Ultra-brief history of Vim
        (yes, you can skip this if you are in a hurry, but don't)

   * Ed is the official UNIX editor. It was the first terminal editor
     ever created specifically to help develop UNIX itself (the same
     reason that the C language was invented).

   * Ex is an improved version of Ed. It kept compatibility with Ed but
     added additional features such as a "visual" mode.

   * Vi (pronounced V-I) *is* ex in visual mode. In fact, the original
     configuration file is still called ~/.exrc.

   * Ex/Vi have been installed on millions systems since the 80s
     including all variations of UNIX (macOS/darwin, BSD, Solaris/SunOS,
     AIX, IRIX, etc.) and Linux (Ubuntu/Debian, RedHat, Suse, Nix,
     Alpine, BusyBox, etc.). Many of these, however, have aliased vi to
     vim, but not all. Alpine/BusyBox use a special version of vi. BSD
     uses nvi (not nvim) is based on the original UNIX vi.

   * Vim is an "improved" version of Vi which added many significant
     improvements (and many unnecessary ones). Most systems have vim.

    STOP: You really should take the time to learn the ed editor before
    proceeding to learn vi/vim. It takes about 20 minutes. The rest of
    this tutorial will make much more sense and your ability to modify
    text files and streams from the command line without an editor using
    the sed sed command will be greately improved.
